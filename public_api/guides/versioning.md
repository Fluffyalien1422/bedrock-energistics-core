# Versioning

Both Bedrock Energistics Core and Bedrock Energistics Core API use a modified version of [Semantic Versioning v2](https://semver.org/).

Note that Bedrock Energistics Core and Bedrock Energistics Core API are versioned independently of each other. Each Bedrock Energistics Core API release will note which Bedrock Energistics Core versions it supports.

The only change to Semantic Versioning is that APIs marked as `@beta` may be changed or removed in any minor update.

APIs **not** marked as `@beta` can only be changed or removed in major updates, as per Semantic Versioning.
