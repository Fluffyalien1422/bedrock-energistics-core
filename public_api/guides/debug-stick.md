# Debug Stick

The debug stick is an item that can be used to set the values of storage types in a machine in-game.

Use the `/scriptevent fluffyalien_energisticscore:debug.get_debug_stick` command to get the debug stick.

Sneak and interact with a machine while there is no entity to open the debug stick UI.
