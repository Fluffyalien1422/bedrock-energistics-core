# Debugging

## Debug Mode

Use debug mode to view data and set variables in a machine.

Enable debug mode with the `/scriptevent fluffyalien_energisticscore:debug.enable_debug_mode` command. It can be ended by restarting the server or running `/reload`.

Hold a stick while debug mode is active to view information about the machine you're looking at. Sneak while looking at a machine and holding a stick to open the edit variables menu.

## Print Networks

Use the `/scriptevent fluffyalien_energisticscore:debug.print_networks` command to print all networks in the world.
