# Machine Allocation Priority

> [!note]
> Remember to update the machine's networks using if any tags change. The simplest way to manually trigger a network update is with the [MachineNetwork.updateWithBlock](https://fluffyalien1422.github.io/bedrock-energistics-core/api/classes/API.MachineNetwork.html#updateWithBlock) function.

A machine's priority during network allocation can be changed using the `fluffyalien_energisticscore:priority.{value}` tag. The default priority is `0`.

**Examples:** `fluffyalien_energisticscore:priority.-1`, `fluffyalien_energisticscore:priority.0`, `fluffyalien_energisticscore:priority.1`

All machines in the same priority group will recieve an equal amount of remaining budget at the time of allocation. Groups with higher priorities will recieve allocations first.

For example, if the priority groups are `0` and `-1`, then the machines in group `0` will each recieve an equal split of the budget and the machines in group `-1` will each recieve an equal split of the remaining budget (if applicable) **after** group `0` have received their allocations.
