# Bedrock Energistics Core

APIs for creating tech add-ons.

## Features

- Machines using these APIs work with each other even if they're from different add-ons.
- Simple APIs for basic machines, while still having more powerful APIs for more complicated machines.
- Item storage APIs without persistent entities.
- Easily create machine UI.
- Create your own storage types (water, lava, etc) and share them between add-ons, not just energy.
